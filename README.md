# qMRI-workshop: T1 and PD session

## Setup

### matlab    (Exercises 1 - 5)
All material is provided as matlab scripts under `matlab/` for use with a matlab instance and SPM, make sure to add the path of the project to make functions available.
[Matlab](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/) + [SPM](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/download/)

*Software Requirements:* You need to get the following dependencies and add them to your matlab path (best clone them all within one directory and add the directory as seen in the matlab exercise scripts):
- Exercise 4: [Mezerlab - M0_to_PD](https://github.com/MezerLab/M0_to_PD) + [Vistasoft](https://github.com/vistalab/vistasoft)
- Exercise 5: [Mezerlab - MDM](https://github.com/MezerLab/MDM_toolbox) + [boundedline - pkg](https://github.com/kakearney/boundedline-pkg)

Easiest is to copy the data folder (see below) to `matlab/` and `cd` there inside *matlab*. You can then use the scripts as they are. only note the directory to which you cloned the above git repositories.

### python    (Exercises 1 - 3)
There is jupyter notebooks provided for Exercises *1-3* under `python/`.
To:
- Use directly - best open a new tab: [![Binder](/.binder/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/schmidtijoe/qMRI-workshop/master) - Navigate to `python/` and run through the notebooks
- Use from [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com). $\leftarrow$ **Click Link - switch to Github tab on landing page - Search this very github**:`https://github.com/schmidtijoe/qMRI-workshop` and the notebooks should be available to be hosted in Colab. You can execute all cells there and run through in your browser.
- Run from your own favorite distribution: (check requirements.txt)

## Data
- For Exercises 1-3 you can find the example data here: [example 3 - data](https://owncloud.gwdg.de/index.php/s/HoY0Kl4aNetZbJA)
- Exercises 4-5 can be done with example data provided in the respective github repositories (M0_to_PD, MDM_toolbox). See documentation in the matlab scripts.
